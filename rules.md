# Rules

1) Respect Discord Staff, they are there to make the discord a fun and safe place to hang out!

2) Don't abuse bots outside of #bots! Once in a while is ok but if you want to spam or test please use #bots.

3) No swearing!

4) Do not advertise, advertising is a cheap way to get to the top, please don't do so on this server! This goes for discord links as well as YouTube links.

5) Do NOT ask to be a staff member! We will instantly decline and we won't be happy with you!

6) Do not impersonate anyone!

7) Do not spam the chat!

8) Do not send duplicate messages, this is considered spam and is not acceptable.

9) Do not attempt to mention @everyone or @here. It's disabled for a reason.

10) No inappropriate usernames or avatars.

11) Absolutely no NSFW. Instant, permanent ban.
