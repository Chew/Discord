# Rules

1) Ask Ops/Admins or Chew for help (they should know what to do).

2) Respect Discord Staff, they are there to make the discord a fun and safe place to hang out!

3) Don't abuse bots outside of #bots! Once in a while is ok but if you want to spam or test please use #bots.

4) Before you ask anything in #discussions, please check [FAQ](faq) and #information before you do so, it will not only save your time, but ours too!

5) No swearing!

6) Do not advertise, advertising is a cheap way to get to the top, please don't do so on this server! This goes for discord links as well as YouTube links.

7) Do NOT ask to be a staff member! We will instantly decline and we won't be happy with you!

8) Do not impersonate anyone!

9) Do not spam the chat!

10) Do not send duplicate messages, this is considered spam and is not acceptable.

11) Do not attempt to mention @everyone or @here. It's disabled for a reason.

12) When you change your nickname, you agree to these terms:
- a) The nickname and your ability to set it can be revoked at any time.
- b) The nickname is family-friendly.

13) Absolutely no NSFW. Instant, permanent ban.
