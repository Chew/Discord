# Rules

1) Ask Ops/Admins or Chew for help (they should know what to do).

2) Respect Discord Staff, they are there to make the discord a fun and safe place to hang out!

3) Don't abuse bots! (They have mode +B and Bot tag)

4) Before you ask anything in #discussions, please check [FAQ](faq) and #information before you do so, it will not only save your time, but ours too!

5) No swearing!

6) Do not advertise, advertising is a cheap way to get to the top, please don't do so on this server! This goes for discord links as well as YouTube links.

7) Do not bring bots in without permission. Please ask first.

8) Do NOT ask to be a staff member on the discord! We will instantly decline and we won't be happy with you!

9) Do not impersonate anyone!

10) Do not spam the chat!

11) Do not send duplicate messages, this is spam and not acceptable.

12) Do not mention @everyone for no reason. That's why it's disabled.

13) When you change your nickname, you agree to these terms:
- a) I am able to remove your nickname and remove your permissions to change them at any time.
- b) The nickname is family-friendly.

14) Absolutely no NSFW outside of #mature-chatroom. Instant, permanent ban.
